Background
----------

While learning how to use GTK+, I wrote a small demo program to
explore the features of GTK+.  Later, I wanted to determine if using
either Glade (the GTK+ interface designer) or Gtkmm (the GTK+ C++
bindings) could make my life simpler, by making programs smaller,
better structured and more maintainable.

This small package includes the same small program written in:

* C.
* C, using libglade.
* C, using and GObject and libglade.
* C++, using Gtkmm.
* C++, using Gtkmm and libglademm.

All of these programs use exactly the same interface, and behave in
exactly the same way, using the same program logic.  This allows an
accurate comparison to be made between the different programs, in
terms of their size, structure and logic.


Documentation
-------------

To enable other programmers to become more familiar with GTK+, all the
source files are extensively commented, so that it can be seen what
every function is doing.

A PDF document (ogcalc.pdf) further documents ogcalc, as well as GTK+
in general.  While not intended to replace the GTK+ tutorial, it is
hoped that this will be found to be of use.


Building
--------

Run:

* "./configure" to configure the source tree.
* "make" or "make all" to build everything.
* "glade-2 ogcalc.glade" to view/edit the Glade interface.

All the programs require the GTK+ 2.0 or 2.2 libraries and headers to
be installed.  ogcalc-gl requires libglade and its headers to be
installed.  ogcalcmm requires Gtkmm, libglademm and their headers to
be installed.

On a Debian unstable system, these packages are required:
ogcalc: libgtk2.0-dev
ogcalc-gl: libglade2-dev
ogcalcmm: libgtkmm2.0-dev, libglademm2.0-dev
glade-2 provides the Glade interface editor.
