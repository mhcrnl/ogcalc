  The G_DEFINE_TYPE macro introduced with GLib 2.4 has replaced the
  ogcalc_get_type function in C/gobject/ogcalc.c, as well as some
  function prototypes.

* Major changes in release 2.0.1:

** Changes

  Corrected the PG calculation, which was out by a factor of 100.

* Major changes in release 2.0.0:

** Changes

  The Gtkmm examples have been reworked for version 2.4.x.  This uses
  the new version of libsigc++ (2.0) which renamed a number of classes
  in order to bring the naming scheme in line with that of the C++
  Standard Library.

  A number of typos have been corrected.

* Major changes in release 1.0.4:

** Changes

  The Ogcalc class in C/ogcalc did not destroy the contained GladeXML
  interface description when it was destroyed.  A class initialiser
  has been added to override the GObject finalize() method so that the
  GladeXML object may be unreferenced in the Ogcalc finaliser.

* Major changes in release 1.0.3:

** Changes

  The main() function in C/plain/ogcalc.c has been split into helper
  functions for greater clarity.

  The Glade-using examples no longer use glade_xml_reparent_widget(),
  instead loading the interface from a specified root in the tree.

  The tutorial has been completely proof-read, and several minor
  technical errors have been corrected.  In addition, manual build
  instructions have been added.

* Major changes in release 1.0.2:

** New features

  A GObject-based version of ogcalc has been added, along with a new
  chapter in the tutorial.

  so that each version of ogcalc may be built in isolation.
