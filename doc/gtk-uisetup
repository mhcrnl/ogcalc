Creating the interface
----------------------

Due to the need to build up an interface from the bottom up, due to
the containers being nested, the interface is constructed starting
with the window, then the containers that fit in it.  The widgets the
user will use go in last.  This is illustrated below.

.. _qt-fig-packing:
.. _qt-fig-packing-1:
.. figure:: figures/qt-packing-1.*
   :figwidth: 100%
   :width: 40%
   :align: center

   An empty window

.. _qt-fig-packing-2:
.. figure:: figures/qt-packing-2.*
   :figwidth: 100%
   :width: 40%
   :align: center

   Addition of a :c:type:`GtkVBox`

.. _qt-fig-packing-3:
.. figure:: figures/qt-packing-3.*
   :figwidth: 100%
   :width: 40%
   :align: center

   Addition of three :c:type:`GtkHBox` widgets

.. _qt-fig-packing-4:
.. figure:: figures/qt-packing-4.*
   :figwidth: 100%
   :width: 40%
   :align: center

   Addition of five more :c:type:`GtkHBox` widgets, used to ensure
   visually appealing widget placement

.. _qt-fig-packing-final:
.. figure:: figures/qt-packing-final.*
   :figwidth: 100%
   :width: 40%
   :align: center

   Addition of all of the user-visible widgets


.. _fig-packing:
.. _fig-packing-1:
.. figure:: figures/packing-1.*
   :figwidth: 100%
   :width: 40%
   :align: center

   An empty window

.. _fig-packing-2:
.. figure:: figures/packing-2.*
   :figwidth: 100%
   :width: 40%
   :align: center

   Addition of a :c:type:`GtkVBox`

.. _fig-packing-3:
.. figure:: figures/packing-3.*
   :figwidth: 100%
   :width: 40%
   :align: center

   Addition of a second :c:type:`GtkVBox`; this has uniformly-
   sized children (it is *homogeneous*), unlike the first.

.. _fig-packing-4:
.. figure:: figures/packing-4.*
   :figwidth: 100%
   :width: 40%
   :align: center

   Addition of three :c:type:`GtkHBox` widgets

.. _fig-packing-5:
.. figure:: figures/packing-5.*
   :figwidth: 100%
   :width: 40%
   :align: center

   Addition of five more :c:type:`GtkHBox` widgets, used to ensure
   visually appealing widget placement

.. _fig-packing-6:
.. figure:: figures/packing-final.*
   :figwidth: 100%
   :width: 40%
   :align: center

   Addition of all of the user-visible widgets

Once a widget has been created, signal handlers may be connected to
its signals.  After this is completed, the interface can be displayed,
and the main *event loop* may be entered.  The event loop
receives events from the keyboard, mouse and other sources, and causes
the widgets to emit signals.  To end the program, the event loop must
first be left.
