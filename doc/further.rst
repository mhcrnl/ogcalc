Further Reading
===============

The GTK+ Tutorial, and the GTK+ documentation are highly recommended.
These are available from `gtk.org <http://www.gtk.org/>`_.  The Gtkmm
documentation is available from `gtkmm.org <http://www.gtkmm.org>`_.
Unfortunately, some parts of these manuals are as yet incomplete.  I
hope that they will be fully documented in the future, since without
good documentation, it will not be possible to write programs that
take advantage of all the capabilities of GTK+ and Gtkmm, without
having to read the original source code.  While there is nothing wrong
with reading the source, having good documentation is essential for
widespread adoption of GTK+.

Documentation and examples of GObject are scarce, but Mathieu Lacage
has wrote an excellent tutorial.  This is unfortunately no longer
available, but parts of it were merged with the main API documentation
at `developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable
<https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable/>`_.
